This repo contains the MATLAB codes related to the paper Observability and State Estimation for Smooth and Nonsmooth Differential Algebraic Equation Systems. There are two MATLAB m files, the first is for the application of the S-EKF and L-SERC observability test on a Wind turbine power system with the output function y = EQ V. The second if for the application of the same Algorithms on the same system, but with the nonsmooth output function y = min(y,0.98).
